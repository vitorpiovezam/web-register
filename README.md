# Registration control system

This is my project, designed to meet the needs of a small company in SÃ£o Paulo.

It is a system of registration of third companies, which divides them between effective and secondary, with functions of searches and filters.

## Getting Started

The project was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP and Javascript.

I used a MySQL database to store and manage cadastral data, in which the stored information was migrated from one originally made in Excel and MS Access.

The original table was removed for obvious reasons. 

I left in this repo a .sql ready to be exported to your localhost, with fake information just for testing.

### Prerequisites


An apache server to run the front and backend and a MySQL server localhost with a DB, and a table  for each month of the year, (which can be imported from the test.sql file);
